README - NYAccessible
</h1>
This project is to find accessible routes from Point A to Point B for differently abled people. The idea comprises of using 311, Vision Zero and crowd-sourced data to figure out what routes are most accessible, friendly and safe in NYC.

The project started as a National Day of Civic Hacking and the project is still under construction. 

We can do with some awesome people who want to contribute. Contact us for further details !!
